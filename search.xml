    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I had already have a long time to update my blog. Because I changed my PC to MAC. My blog is free and it use Hoxe rely on GitHub. Means it should use Git to connect, and Git has a SHH (like a code). When I change my computer I must change my SHH and arrange Hexo again. I did it and update a new post, a discus note, then I got a problem. There have some formula in it. If you want show the formula in blog the markdwon document should be transform to HTML, and the formula should transform from LaTeX to Mathjax format. It like the formula $\cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$ will become \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1, never show correct style \(\cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1\) Another problem again. I search many websites and it didn’t work, feel maybe the themes did not support mathjax format. So I decide change my blog themes. So I changed my blog themes. congratulations! We have a hole new website! And it welcome the new year, by the way. I will keep writing fighting !!!]]></content>

The associations of selected technical parameters with discus throwing performance: a cross-sectional study. Sports Biomechanics / International Society of Biomechanics in Sports, 6(January 2015), 269–284. https://doi.org/10.1080/14763140701489744 Abstract : The aim of this study was to identify associations between discus throwing performance and the technical parameters of: hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separation, trunk forward–backward tilt, and throwing-arm elevation angles. 研究的目标是确定运动表现和技术参数的关系：髋-肩和肩-上臂分离，躯干前后倾以及投掷手臂的仰角。 —-研究目的 Video data of male and female discus throwers’ competitive performances were captured during major competitions. Real-life。Real-life three-dimensional coordinates of 21 body landmarks, and the discus’s centre, were obtained for 94 trials using the direct linear transformation procedure.Each technical parameter was reduced at six critical instants（关键帧）.The trend of each parameter across four standards of performance was analysed separately for both sexes. —-研究方法 For the female throwers, hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separations after the flight phase, as well as forward– backward trunk tilts at the beginning and end of the throwing procedure were associated with performance. 对于女性运动员，髋-肩和肩在腾空阶段分离和投掷过程中前后躯干倾斜角度与运动表现有联系。 For male throwers, only the hip–shoulder separation immediately before the flight phase was associated with performance. 对于男性运动员，只有腾空阶段之前髋-肩立即分离与运动表现有联系。 These findings suggest that the relationships between technical parameters and discus throwing performance are different for males and females. 研究建议技术参数和铁饼投掷的运动表现的关系在男性和女性之间有区别。 —-研究结果 Our results suggest that elite female discus throwers are reliant on effective technique throughout the throwing procedure to achieve long distances, whereas male discus throwers may have a relatively homogeneous technique, and a dependence on physical strength to achieve their long throws.我们的结果：优秀女子铁饼运动员在投掷过程中通过依靠有效的投掷技术来达到较好的成绩，而男子铁饼运动员可能具有相同的投掷技巧，通过身体力量来达到较好的成绩。 —-研究结论 Introduction The most important component of official distance is the vacuum flight distance. 官方距离最重要的组成部分是真空飞行距离。 The vacuum flight distance of the discus is dependent on discus release characteristics: the release speed, and the angle and height of release. 铁饼的真空飞行距离取决于铁饼的出手特征：出手速度、出手角度和高度。 Among these release characteristics, release speed is the single most important determinant of the difference in vacuum flight distance among athletes (Bartlett, 1992; Hay and Yu, 1995). 整个出手特征中，出手速度最重要。 The official distance thrown determines the winner of each competition. The most important component of official distance is the vacuum flight distance, although the aerodynamic distance and the distance lost at release also affect official distance(Hay and Yu, 1995). 官方成绩决定了运动员的名次。官方成绩最重要的组成部分是真空飞行距离。 The vacuum flight distance of the discus is dependent on discus release characteristics: the release speed, and the angle and height of release. 真空成绩取决于出手特征：出手速度，出手角度和出手高度。 Among these release characteristics, release speed is the single most important determinant of the difference in vacuum flight distance among athletes (Bartlett, 1992; Hay and Yu, 1995). 整个出手特征中，出手速度是一个重要特征。 To achieve the longest vacuum flight distance, athletesmust carefully control their releases so that the discus is thrown at the maximum height possible, combined with optimal release angles, and most importantly with the maximum possible speed, which is the most important factor contributing to the vacuum flight distance, and therefore long throws (Bartlett, 1992; Hay and Yu, 1995). 为达到最长的真空飞行，运动员细心的控制出手特征。 All other release characteristics lie within a limited range of values, and may only be important in the manner in which they affect release speed (Hubbard, de Mestre, and Scott, 2001). 所有出手的特征都在一个有限的范围内，并且可能只在影响出手速度的方式中起重要作用。 From complex, high-speed movements made within the confined space of the throwing circle, an athlete may be able to increase the release speed above that possible with a standing throw alone (Hay, 1993). 在投掷圈的受限空间内，从复杂、高速的动作中，运动员可以通过单独投掷提高其速度。 Therefore, optimizing technique to achieve the largest release speed is vital in discus throwing. 因此，优化技术以获得最大的出手速度是铁饼投掷的关键。 The flight of the discus after release has been thoroughly examined, most often using a wind tunnel to investigate the aerodynamic properties of the discus itself (Frohlich, 1981; Ganslen, 1964; Taylor, 1932;Terauds, 1978b) 出手后的铁饼飞行已经被完全验证了，最多的是调查铁饼在风洞中的空气动力学属性。 However, the relevance to the athlete from this line of study is limited, since athletes are unable to control environmental conditions, and studying the flight of the discus in isolation to the athlete’s throwing technique does not allow for any cause and effect relationship between technique and discus flight to be determined. 然而，这项研究与运动员的相关性有限，因为运动员是一种不可控制的环境条件，在要确定铁饼和运动技术关系中，任何原因和效果关系都不能孤立运动员的投掷技巧来研究铁饼的飞行。 Kinetic analyses of discus throwing during competition are difficult because instrumentation of the circle with force plates during competition is not often allowed. 动力学在比赛中分析铁饼的投掷非常困难，因为比赛中在投掷圈内放置测力台并不是经常允许。 Therefore, the extrapolation推断 of kinetic data obtained in a laboratory setting, such as that from Yu and colleagues (Yu, Broker, and Silvester, 2002), is most practical. 另外从实验室获得的运动学数据来推断是最实际的。 Kinematic analysis is probably best suited to use during competition, as it causes minimal interference to the athletes. 因为最小的影响运动员，运动学分析可能是最适合运用分析比赛的。 Few kinematic analyses of discus throwing technique have been made, and three-dimensional investigations are especially rare. 有一些铁饼投掷技术的运动学分析，然而三维研究非常罕见。 While discus release characteristics such as velocities, heights, and angles have been reported (Ariel, 2000; Gregor, Whiting, andMcCoy, 1985; HayandYu, 1995; Knicker, 1990; McCoy, Whiting, Rich, and Gregor, 1985;Terauds, 1978a, 1978b;Ward, 1969), these have rarely been linked to variations in technique, and sample sizes have been small. 虽然有一些铁饼的出手特征已经被报道过，例如速度、高度和角度，但是这些极少的联系到各种技术并且样本量很小。 Hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separation, trunk forward–backward tilt, and throwing-arm elevation angles are important technical parameters that are repeatedly emphasized in coaching literature (Burke, 1988; Ecker, 1971; Hay, 1993; Johnson, 1985; Knicker, 1988; Maughan, 1964). 髋-肩和肩-肘角度，躯干前后倾角度以及投掷臂升高角度是非常重要的技术参数，它们经常在教练的书籍中反复强调。 A recent extensive literature review, however, failed to reveal any scientific evidence to support the coaching literature. 最近大量的文献调查，都缺少科学的证据来证明教练的书籍。 Furthermore, the kinematic analyses performed by Susˇanka and colleagues (Sus ˇanka, Dumbrovsky ˆ, Barak, S ˇtepa ´nek, and Nosek, 1988), Knicker (1990), Lindsay (1991), and Hay and Yu (1995) did not identify an ideal technique. 而且，运动学分析都没有识别出理想技术。 The selected technical parameters can clearly describe actions of a discus thrower throughout自始自终 the throwing procedure. 选择的技术参数可以清楚的描述整个投掷过程的铁饼投掷动作。 The angles between the hips and the shoulders and between the shoulders and the throwing arm are representative of the amount of stretch experienced by the trunk rotators and arm horizontal adductors内收. 投掷臂的髋肩-肩肘角度代表总的躯干旋转和上肢水平内收的伸展经验。 The angles of trunk forward–backward tilt and of the elevation of the throwing arm have been used in kinematic analyses of the shot put (Alexander, Lindner, and Whalen, 1996; Young and Li, 2005) to describe body orientation during the throwing procedure. 躯干的前倾-后仰角度和投掷臂的升高曾用于铅球的运动学分析，来描述投掷过程中身体的方向。 These technical parameters, together with anthropometric parameters of the individual athlete, largely determine the height and angle of release (Hay, 1993; Sˇtepa ´nek, 1990). 这些技术参数结合人体测量学的个体参数在很大程度上决定了运动员的出手高度和角度。 We believe the trunk forward–backward tilt and throwing-arm elevation angles are associated with the vertical distance travelled by the discus during the throwing procedure, which influences the vertical velocity at release and, therefore, the speed and angle of release. 我们认为，躯干向前向后倾斜和投掷手臂仰角与铁饼投掷过程中的垂直距离有关，这影响了投掷时的垂直速度，因此影响了投掷的速度和角度。 We believe that the second single support phase is the most important time to increase vertical velocity, since it is the phase that immediately precedes优先 the release. 我们认为第二次单支撑阶段是提升垂直速度最重要的时间，因为这个阶段直接优先于出手。 Methods paricipants Altogether, 93 legal trials of 51 male and 42 female discus throwers competing in the men’s and women’s discus throw finals of the 1990 Goodwill Games, the 1990 US Olympic Festival, and the USNationalOutdoor Championships and OlympicTeamTrials from 1997 to 2005 were included in this study. In the case of an athlete having multiple trials available for analysis, his or her performance with the longest official distance was selected. All throwers were right-handed. The official distances ranged from 41.55m to 68.08m for female discus throwers, and from 48.91m to 67.40m for male discus throwers. All trials were divided into four groups for each sex according to the official distances recorded at the meets: below 55m group, 55 to 60m group, 60 to 65m group, and over 65m group. The numbers of throwers in each group are shown in Tables I and II. 研究包含在1990年的Goodwill, the 1990 US Olympic Festival, and the USNationalOutdoor Championships and OlympicTeamTrials from 1997 to 2005 男子51投和女子42投总共93投。 最好成绩： 女：41.5-68.08 男：48.9-67.4 男女分为四组分别成绩是 55以下 55-60 60-65 65以上 ### Data collection 两台S-VHS摄像机拍摄60HZ。一台在投掷圈的后面，另外一台在投掷圈的右边。主光轴约90°。使用24点标定框架标点，标定空间(2.5m long × 2m wide × 2.5m high) 。 Five global reference markers were placed in the discus throwing circle for establishing a global reference frame during data reduction (Figure 1). 5个球形参考点放置于投掷圈用于在数据平滑时建立一个球形参考框架。 Data reduction 直接线性变换(DLT)建立真实三维坐标。X轴指向投掷方向，Y轴指向面向投掷方向的左侧，Z轴指向上方。 视频从最大后摆的前5帧到铁饼出手的后4帧剪切。手工标记每一帧的人体标志点和铁饼重心。关键帧-右脚离地，左脚离地，右脚触地，左脚触地和出手从每一投的视频中识别。五个关键帧数用于同步两侧视频。三维坐标通过Butterworth low-pass digital filter 过滤，截断频率7.14Hz。所用的解析软件是MSDLT 5.5版本(北卡chapel hill自己的软件)。 投掷中的6个关键时刻被识别：最大后摆，右脚离地，左脚离地，右脚着地，左脚着地和出手。(Bartlett, 1992; Hay and Yu, 1995) 6个关键时刻分离出5个阶段：第一次单支撑阶段，第一次双支撑阶段，腾空阶段，第二次单支撑阶段和第二次双支撑阶段或出手阶段。(Hay and Yu, 1995) 一个躯干的参考框架建立在每一个关键时刻去计算髋-肩和肩-肘分离角。躯干的参考框架建立在这样一个相对于髋的直线上——X轴指向前方，Y轴指向左方，X轴从左右髋的中点到左右肩的中点较高的方向。 The global three-dimensional coordinates of the right and left hips and shoulders and the centre of the discus at each critical instant were transferred to the trunk reference frame. 每个关键时刻左右髋、肩的球形三维坐标以及铁饼的中心被转化为躯干的参考框架中。 髋肩分离角α和肩肘分离角β计算的方式： \[ \alpha=\arccos \Big( \frac{\upsilon_s \bullet\upsilon_h}{|\upsilon_s||\upsilon_h|}\Big) \] \[ \beta=\arccos \Big( \frac{\upsilon_d \bullet\upsilon_s}{|\upsilon_d||\upsilon_s|}\Big) \] 此公式是空间两直线求夹角的公式： 设两条直线的方向向量分别为S1=(m1,s1,p1）、S2=(m2,s2,p2),模分别为|S1|、|S2|, 两条直线的夹角a 则: \[ \cos a=\frac{S1\bullet S2}{(|S1||S2|)} \] \[ a =\arccos \bigg( \frac{S1\bullet S2}{(|S1||S2|)}\bigg) \] \(v_h,v_s,\)和\(v_d\)分别是右髋到左髋，右肩到左肩和铁饼中心到右肩的向量，在XY平面如图所示。 定义髋-肩和肩-肘分离角。髋-肩分离角是计算每个关键时刻XY平面身体框架左右宽关节中心向量与左右肩关节中心向量的夹角。The line of the hips leading the line of the shoulders is defined as a positive angle正角. 由髋轴领导的肩轴组成的夹角定义为正角。每个关键时刻由左右肩关节中心向量和右肩中心与铁饼中心向量在躯干参考框架XY平面上所形成的夹角为肩肘分离角。肩轴领导投掷臂轴定义为正角。 The value of a was positive if the vector product of vs and vh was pointing towards the superior direction, which meant that the right hip was leading the right shoulder. The value of a was negative if the vector product of vs and vh was pointing towards the inferior direction, which meant that the right shoulder was leading the right hip. The value of b was positive if the vector product of vd and vs was pointing towards the superior direction, which meant that the right shoulder was leading the right arm. The value of b was negative if the vector product of vd and vs was pointing towards the inferior direction, which meant that the right arm was leading the right shoulder. 如果向量\(v_s\)和\(v_h\)的乘积指向向上的方向，α是正值，意味着右髋引导右肩。 如果向量\(v_s\)和\(v_h\)的乘积指向向下的方向，α的值是负值，意味着右肩引导右髋。 如果向量\(v_d\)和\(v_s\)的乘积指向向上的方向，β的值是正的，意味着右肩引导右臂。 如果向量\(v_d\)和\(v_s\)的乘积指向向下的方向，β的值是负的，意味着右臂引领右肩。 superior 和 inferior在解剖中是指上和下的关系 Now, there are more directional terms than just toward the front or the back of something. We also have the term superior, which means towards the head or above something, and the word inferior, which means towards the feet or below something1. superior and inferior line of the hips, the y-axis was parallel to the horizontal plane and pointing towards the left side of the trunk, and the z-axis was pointing upwards and perpendicular to the horizontal plane. The trunk forward–backward tilt angle, left–right tilt angle, and left–right rotation angle were defined as the three Euler rotations of the trunk reference frame relative to the ground reference frame with an x-y-z rotation order. Trunk forward–backward tilt is reported as the first rotation of the Euler angles. A positive value of x indicated a forward trunk tilt, while a negative value of x indicated a backward trunk tilt (Figure 3). This can be thought of as pure forward–backward trunk tilt. Isolated trunk left–right tilt was not calculated. 为了确定躯干前倾后仰交（\(\chi\)），建立一个X轴方向指向髋轴前方，Y轴指向躯干左侧并且平行于水平面，Z轴指向上方并且垂直于水平面的大地坐标系。躯干前后倾角，左右倾角和左右旋转角度定义为相对于大地坐标系以躯干框架带有x-y-z旋转顺序的三个欧拉角。躯干前后倾角视为欧拉角的第一次旋转。\(\chi\)的正值表明躯干前倾，而负角表示躯干后仰（图3）。这样就可以认为是一个纯粹的躯干前倾后仰。独立躯干的左右倾斜而不计算。 投掷臂提升角(\(\delta\))为计算每个关键时刻： \[ \delta= \arctan\Bigg[ \frac {z_d-z_{s,r}}{\sqrt{(x_d-x_{s,r})^2+(y_d-y_{s,r})^2}}\Bigg] \] where xs,r, ys,r, and zs,r,and xd, yd, and zd, are the three-dimensional coordinates measured in the global reference frame of the right shoulder joint centre and the centre of the discus, respectively. A positive value of d indicated that the position of the discus was higher than that of the right shoulder, whereas a negative value of d indicated that the position of the discus was lower than that of the right shoulder (Figure 4). \(x_{s,r}\) ,\(y_{s,r}\),\(z_{s,r}\)和\(x_d\)，\(y_d\)，\(z_d\)是以右肩中心与铁饼中心的球形坐标系的各自三维坐标。\(\delta\)正值表示铁饼的位置高于右肩，当\(\delta\)值为负值表示铁饼的位置低于右肩(图4)。 Data analysis The male and female throwers were analysed separately in an attempt to control for confounding factors that were not controlled for in this study. 分别分析男性和女性的投掷者，试图控制在本研究中未被控制的混杂因素。 The four groups based on official distance for each sex were coded as groups 1 to 4, where grouping generally represented performance, and was used as the dependent variable for statistical analyses. 根据每个性别的官方距离的四组被编码为组1至4，其中分组通常代表表现，并且被用作统计分析的因变量。 The difference in sample size of the groups was accounted for by weighting the means for each group with respect to sample size. 组间样本量的差异是通过对每个组的样本量进行加权平均来解释的。 Linear trend analyses were performed to determine the trend of the mean hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separation angles, and the mean trunk forward–backward tilt and throwing-arm elevation angles at each critical instant with group, as well as the trend of the maximum angles of trunk forward–backward tilt and throwing-arm elevation during the second single support phase with group. 进行线性趋势分析，以确定平均髋-肩和肩-臂分离角度的趋势，每组关键时刻的平均躯干前后倾角和投掷臂仰角以及在第二次单支撑阶段躯干前后倾角和投掷臂抬高的最大角度。 A linear trend analysis assesses whether the slope of the standardized regression line is equal to zero, and so if the dependent variable is significantly related to the independent variable. 线性趋势分析评估标准化回归线的斜率是否等于零，如果等于零则因变量与自变量显着相关。 A linear trend analysis is a more sophisticated version of a simple correlation, because the F-ratio directly reflects the strength of the association between the two variables. 线性趋势分析是一个简单相关的更复杂的版本，因为F比率直接反映了两个变量之间关联的强度。 The significance level for the F-test and t-test of a linear trend analysis is the same (since the square of the t is the same as the F-ratio); however, both statistics will be reported since the sign of the t indicates the direction of the relationship (Elston and Johnson, 1994; Myers andWell, 1991). An a priori type I error rate of α= 0.05 per comparison was chosen to indicate statistical significance. The alpha level for each individual test was not adjusted because the trend of each technical parameter with discus throwing performance was analysed in isolation.We did not consider the associations of combinations of technical parameters with performance, or the inter- relationships between technical parameters. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 11.5 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL.). 写的啥，看不懂，google翻译的 线性趋势分析的F检验和t检验的显着性水平相同（因为t的平方与F比率相同）。 然而，这两个统计数据将被报告，因为t的符号表明了关系的方向（Elston and Johnson，1994; Myers and Well，1991）。 选择每个比较a = 0.05的先验I型错误率来表示统计学显着性。 由于各项技术参数对铁饼投掷性能的影响是单独进行分析的，我们没有考虑到每个单项测试的α水平。我们没有考虑技术参数组合与性能的关系，或者技术参数之间的相互关系。 所有统计分析均采用SPSS 11.5版统计软件（SPSS Inc.，Chicago，IL）进行。 Result Discussion and implication Conclusion Although the results of this study may not be applicable to a different population of discus throwers, they provide important information to coaches and elite discus throwers and the following conclusions appear warranted: 虽然这项研究的结果可能不适用于不同人群的铁饼运动员，但他们为教练员和铁饼运动员提供了重要的信息，并得出如下结论： - Large hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separations after the flight phase, and more forward trunk tilt at the beginning and more backward trunk tilt at the end of the end of the throwing procedure, are important technical characteristics of elite female discus throwers with long official distances. - 飞行阶段后较大的髋-肩和肩-臂分离，开始阶段过多的前倾，以及出手阶段后期过多的后倾是官方成绩较好的优秀女子铁饼运动员的重要技术特征。 - Hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separations, trunk forward–backward tilts, and throwing-arm elevations may not be important technical parameters that differentiate the performances of elite male discus throwers. - 髋-肩，肩-臂分离，躯干前后倾，投掷臂抬高可能不是区分男子铁饼优秀运动员表现的重要技术参数。 - Female discus throwers should concentrate on increasing their hip–shoulder and shoulder–arm separations after the flight phase, and releasing the discus when the lines of the hips, shoulders, and throwing arm are parallel. They should also increase their backward trunk tilt during the delivery phase. - 女子铁饼运动员应该集中精力在飞行阶段之后增加他们的髋-肩和肩-臂分离，并且在髋轴，肩轴和投掷臂轴的线条平行时释放铁饼。 在出手阶段，他们也应该增加躯干后倾的角度。 Further investigations are needed to determine which other technical parameters can help differentiate between the performances of male discus throwers and which combinations of technical parameters may differentiate the performances of both male and female discus throwers. 还需要进一步调查，以确定哪些其他技术参数可以帮助区分男性铁饼运动员的表现以及哪些技术参数的组合可以区分男性和女性铁饼运动员的表现。 国内、外优秀女子铁饼运动员掷铁饼技术的比较研究 林辉杰,梁海丹,严波涛,许崇高,张勇. 国内、外优秀女子铁饼运动员掷铁饼技术的比较研究[J]. 中国体育科技,2013,49(01):71-77. 国家体育总局重点实验室项目（２０１１Ｂ０２５）； 上海体育学院研究生教育创新基金项目（ｙｊｓｃｘ２０１２０１３）。 前 言 对 国 内、外优秀女子铁饼运动员掷铁饼技术特征的比较，有助于掌握与克服我国与国外运动员技术的优势与劣势，为我国运动员备战世界大赛提供科学训练依据。 目前，对于我国优秀女子铁饼运动员掷铁饼技术运动学特征的研究还是较多的，但 是，由 于 条 件 的限制，对于国内、外优秀女子铁饼运动员技术直接比较的文献还未曾发现。 在本研究中，将我国重点运动员李艳凤（２０１１年大邱世界锦标赛冠军）、谭 建（２０１１年 大 邱 世 界 锦标 赛 第６名）与多名国外优秀女子铁饼运动员技术的运动学特征进行比较，旨在探索我国运动员技术的优、缺点以及国外运动员的技术特点，从而揭示优秀女子铁饼运动员的一些重要技术特征，为我国女子铁饼运动员的科学训练提供参考。 ## 研究对象与方法 测试对象 本研究选取了２名国内与５名国外优秀女子铁饼运动员作为研究样本，这些运动员个人最好成绩均在奥运会Ａ标（６２ｍ）之 上，本 次 测 量 成 绩（２０１１年 国 际 田 径 钻 石 联赛 上 海 站）均 在奥运会Ｂ标（５９．５ ｍ）之上，基本上代表了目前世界女子铁饼项目的最高水平（表１）。 &gt;要对运动员的水平进行分析，在国内的水平如何，在国外的水平如何。 研究方法 本研究将铁饼技术分为５个 时 相，分别为第1双支撑阶段、第１单支撑阶段、腾空阶段、第 ２ 单支 撑阶段（过 渡阶 段）以及第２双支撑阶段（最 后 用 力 阶 段）。以 右手持饼为例，第１双支撑阶段是指从预摆结束至右脚离地时刻；第１单支撑阶段是指从右脚离地至左脚离地时刻；腾空阶段是指从左脚离地至右脚着地时刻；第２单支撑阶段是指从右脚着地至左脚着地时刻；第２双支撑是指从左脚着地至铁饼出手时刻。 &gt;同样是将投掷动作划分为5个阶段。第一次双支撑，第一次单支撑，腾空阶段、第二次单支撑，第二次单支撑(出手阶段)。 采用2台casio fh25摄像机，主光轴90°夹角，拍摄频率120fps。机高1.2m。 用simi解析。选 择 左 右 侧 手、肘、肩、髋、膝、踝、脚 尖 以 及 头、肩 轴中 点、髋轴中点以及铁饼点等 ２０ 个 点 进 行 解 析。 人体以及环节重心等人体惯性参数依据 dempster人体参数模型计算获得，采用数字滤波进行噪音处理，截止频率选择为８Ｈｚ。 技术指标 真空距离：铁饼飞行的真空距离是去除了流体的影响后铁饼在理论飞行的距离2，计算公式如下： \[ d= \frac{S_R^2\sin\theta_R \cos\theta_R+S_R\cos\theta_R\sqrt{[(S_R\sin\theta_R)^2+2gh_R]}}{g} \] Reference 1.解剖学的解释：链接地址 ↩ 2.Hay J G&amp; Bing Yu.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[想要搞好学术研究，就离不开写论文。现在随着网络和计算机技术的发展，论文也就不单单是paper，几张纸，那么简单。文献已经成为一个系统，所以文献的收集和整理也变成了一个系统的工作。而利用网络和计算机技术来收集整理文献，在论文写作的时候可以起到事倍功半的作用，从而提高工作效率，空余出时间来提升生活质量。 ————一些废话可以略过 我知道有个朋友，下载了好几个G的文献，用几十个文件夹分类。这种精神我很敬佩，但是这样的方式非常不方便，如果突然想要看一篇文章又忘记了在哪个文件夹，题目是什么，要把它找出来就非常不方便了。还有一个朋友，想搞好学术，开始下载国外学术论文软件，发现可以有交流的功能，自诩要与国外学者侃侃而谈。然而轮到自己写论文时连文献下载都有困难重重，看两篇文献后开始百度百科。。。 可见平时的积累很重要，科学的方法也很重要。 这几天学习整理这方面的资料也是搞神经了，国外也有很多科研工具1我把我的一些方法放在这里。之后随时更新。 文献收集整理 国内文献资料收集 国内文献下载就知网，其他的我都没有用，怎么下载我也不太清楚（我都是用的学校的图书馆），反正用百度学术就好了。 国外文献资料收集 其实国内的学术态度大家都懂，论文大多都比较翔。前端的，有价值的文献还是在外文期刊中。 外文期刊搜索引擎可以使用： 百度学术——在这里我要给百度学术点个赞，有可以直接下载的连接，感觉比Google好用。 Google学术(打不开的同学请科学上网) SciHub——SCI文献下载第一站,扫除一切学术障碍，俄国朋友真心牛逼。 PubMed——医学文献数据库（这里吐槽一下学校图书馆的PubMed连接出问题了，竟然好久都不知道，直到一个外聘的教授查文献才发现。。。） 虫部落学术搜索——国内做的包含许多文献库，界面丑陋无比。 Researchgate——相当于学术界的Facebook，大家把自己的文章发布到上面可以相互讨论，有些文章提供下载。 文献资料整理 文献资料整理主要是方便文献的查找阅读和引用。利用文献管理软件来完成。在写作时，把你的文献导出bib.格式可以很方便的插入到你的文章参考文献处。如果一个一个的插入会手残的吧。 NoteExpress——国内的文献管理系统，因为国外的文献管理系统大多不支持中文所以，校园网内可以免费使用。管理国内的文献还是支持中文的好用。 EndNote——国外的文献管理软件，在国内很多人用，但是我不喜欢。 Mendeley——本人使用感觉良好，界面美丽。有2G的云同步，支持Windows，IOS，电脑手机可以同步在线看文献，导出文献，做笔记。只是不能下载文献，需要上传自己的文献PDF到云，但是我有SciHub怕什么呢？ Zotero——国外的很多同志喜欢，我没有用过。 论文写作 如果就是喜欢用word写作完了后改格式我也没有什么好说的，但是一边修改格式一边写作的话就会使效率非常低下。 我的方法是使用Markdown+Pandoc+GitHub。Markdown本身的哲学思想就是专注于写作，这是 一种非常好的写作方式，去除格式的干扰，只用码字。另外Markdown也可以快速插入数学公式、表格、图片、和参考文献（.bib）。Pandoc是和Markdown相配套，让Markdown用于生成其他的文本格式，如HTML，Docx，LaTex，Pdf等等。这样的好处在与写完之后在各种平台上相互转化。比如文章写好后要修改，就转成Docx；上传到博客就用Markdown，或者HTML；有些时候有LaTex的模板，就转为Pdf（但是LaTex制作起来就不那么容易了）。GitHub是用于分享代码的网页，但是现在越来越强大，连这个博客都是建立在GitHub上。GitHub在对于论文写作的好处在于可以实现合作编写文档并能够很好的进行版本控制。 Conversion. I am still chasing the « One file to rule them all » dream: one master file for all kind of outputs, from PDF to html, xml, and so on. I became of big fan of Markdown (a very simple markup language) for the first draft, and am seriously considering it as my master format, relying on Pandoc (free) for all the conversions. Solutions for collaborative writing. As soon as you are not alone on a writing project, you have several options to collaborate. And no, emailing the files back and forth to your colleagues is not a suitable option. Depending on your colleagues and your geekiness level, you have many options, including Google Docs (excellent for comments and review mode), GitHub in combination with Markdown, Overleaf (free)(for LaTeX fans), etc. Bonus point for Mendeley for automatically populating your library with the references cited in the file you received and not in your library yet. Very useful. 参阅Sylvain Deville 的blog有详细的介绍2，也可以看看杨志平的网站3。 在这里我推荐两个Windows的Markdown编辑器（因为我只有Windows(ㄒoㄒ)）。 Atom ——在Github上使用最多的编辑器，非常多的插件。其中Markdown的插件也是非常的厉害。 Atom Typora——界面简洁美观，有Focus Modle和Typewriter Modle并且可以直接导入Docx，导出Docx、Pdf、LaLex。&quot; Typora 还有两个写论文非常好的在线工具： Madoko——非常像Markdown版本的word，功能很强，可以类似word操作排版！ authorea——一个使用Markdown写作，类似GitHub分享后让大家审阅修订的网站，可惜没有几个中国人。 写作流程 运用这个流程现在已经可以运作了。使用Markdown可以实现多种格式的转换，当然用的最多就是Docx，不过要Pdf的话不能直接转换，因为Pdf排版是很麻烦的一件事，Latex虽然是排版之王但是还是太复杂了，因为还要用到code。想要用，好除非安心花一点时间去学习。 写作流程图.PNG 总结一下 但是毕竟用Markdown来进行论文写作的人还是不多，用GitHub来进行版本控制的人也不多。大多数人都是word一直用到底，毕竟是小众啊，毕竟是Geek啊。其实word能用好也是很快速的，Markdown的好处就是代码，更加简洁，不要想排版，让写作更加专注于内容。其实我的初衷是找一个写论文和写post可以相互转化的平台，所以找到了Markdown。 1.这里有个科研工具翻译的网站：http://www.jianshu.com/p/851100273d7a ↩ 2.Sylvain Deville的博客地址：https://sylvaindeville.net/ ↩ 3.杨志平的网志地址：http://www.yangzhiping.com/ ↩]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[# Background 马拉松跑的技术大致和长跑技术相似。由于它的距离长，并且是在地形不一的公路上进行，因此在技术上有其独有特点。在跑步时，上体微向前倾或正直。后蹬的力量较小，大腿向前上方的摆动比较低。 从外形上看，蹬地后小腿向上摆的动作比长跑小些。脚的落点离身体重心投影点较近，并且用全脚掌或脚的外侧先着地，再过渡到全脚掌，着地时应柔和而有弹性，脚应很好地弯曲、缓冲。 但目前对马拉松赛跑的成绩与跑步技术动作的科学研究偏少，很大程度上阻碍了该项运动的发展，因此，探索马拉松运动跑步动作技术的最有效方法对普及与提高我国马拉松运动的发展具有重要的意义。 Abstract：Running economy (RE) has a strong relationship with running performance, and modifiable running biomechanics are a determining factor of RE. The purposes of this review were to (1) examine the intrinsic and extrinsic modifiable biomechanical factors affecting RE; (2) assess training-induced changes in RE and running biomechanics; (3) evaluate whether an economical running technique can be recommended and; (4) discuss potential areas for future research. Based on current evidence, the intrinsic factors that appeared beneficial for RE were using a preferred stride length range, which allows for stride length deviations up to 3 % shorter than preferred stride length; lower vertical oscillation; greater leg stiffness; low lower limb moment of inertia; less leg extension at toe-off; larger stride angles; alignment of the ground reaction force and leg axis during propulsion; maintaining arm swing; low thigh antagonist–agonist muscular coactivation; and low activation of lower limb muscles during propulsion. Extrinsic factors associated with a better RE were a firm, compliant shoe–surface interaction and being barefoot or wearing lightweight shoes. Several other modifiable biomechanical factors presented inconsistent relationships with RE. Running biomechanics during ground contact appeared to play an important role, specifically those during propulsion. Therefore, this phase has the strongest direct links with RE. Recurring methodological problems exist within the literature, such as cross-comparisons, assessing variables in isolation, and acute to short-term interventions. Therefore, recommending a general economical running technique should be approached with caution. Future work should focus on interdisciplinary longitudinal investigations combining RE, kinematics, kinetics, and neuromuscular and anatomical aspects, as well as applying a synergistic approach to understanding the role of kinetics. 摘要: 跑步经济性（RE）与跑步成绩有着密切的关系，而可改变的跑步生物力学又是决定跑步成绩的决定性因素。本综述的目的是（1）检查影响生物力学的内在和外在的可改变的生物力学因素；（2）评估训练引起的RE和跑步生物力学的变化；（3）评估一种经济的跑步技术是否可以。建议和（4）讨论未来研究的潜在领域。根据现有的证据，对RE有利的内在因素是使用一个优选的步长范围。步幅长度偏差比步行长度短3%；低垂直振动；腿部更大的刚度；下肢低转动惯量；脚尖伸展时腿部伸展较少；洛杉矶大跨步的角；地面反力和腿在推进轴对齐；保持摆臂；大腿肌肉共同作用的–激动剂拮抗剂低；和下肢M低活化她的肌肉在推进。 与一个更好的RE相关的外在因素是一个坚定的，兼容的鞋-表面互动，赤脚或穿轻鞋。几个其他的生物力学因素再不一致的关系。在地面接触的运行生物力学似乎起着重要的作用，特别是在推进过程中。因此，这一阶段具有最强的直接与RE的链接。文献中存在反复出现的方法学问题，如交叉比较、孤立评估变量和急性至短期干预。因此，recommendin一般经济运行技术应谨慎处理。今后的工作重点应放在跨学科的纵向调查研究，结合运动学、动力学，并重新neuromuscu在解剖学和解剖学方面，以及应用协同的方法来理解动力学的作用。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Pandoc`s Markdown 语法中文翻译]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F06%2F16%2Fpandoc_maneul(CN)%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[前言 這份文件是 Pandoc 版本 Markdown 語法的中文翻譯。Pandoc 本身是由 John MacFarlane 所開發的文件轉換工具，可以在HTML, Markdown, PDF, TeX…等等格式之間進行轉換。有許多喜歡純文字編輯的人，利用 Pandoc 來進行論文的撰寫或投影片製作。但除了轉換的功能外，Pandoc 所定義的 Markdown 擴充語法也是這套工具的一大亮點，在 Pandoc 的官方使用說明文件中，光是其針對 Markdown 格式的擴充就佔了整整一半左右的篇幅。 本文件翻譯自 Pandoc - Pandoc User’s Guide 中的 “Pandoc’s markdown” 一節。你可以看看這份文件的原始檔、產生文件所使用的 HTML 範本，以及轉換時的命令參數。 以下翻譯開始。 Pandoc’s markdown 與 John Gruber 的 原始 markdown 相比，Pandoc 版本的 markdown 在語法上有額外的擴充與些許的修正。這份文件解釋了這些語法，並指出其與原始 markdown 的差異所在。除非特別提到，不然這些差異均可藉由使用 markdown_strict 而非 markdown 的格式來關閉。單獨一項擴充也可透過 +EXTENSION 或 -EXTENSION 的方式來開啟或關閉。例如，markdown_strict+footnotes 表示加上腳註擴充的原始 markdown，而 markdown-footnotes-pipe_tables 則是拿掉了腳註與管線表格擴充的 pandoc markdown。 哲學 Markdown 是針對易於書寫與閱讀的目標而設計的，特別是在易於閱讀這點上尤為重要： 一份 Markdown 格式的文件應該要能以純文字形式直接發表，並且一眼看過去不存在任何標記用的標籤或格式指令。 John Gruber 這項原則同樣也是 pandoc 在制訂表格、腳註以及其他擴充的語法時，所依循的規範。 然而，pandoc 的目標與原始 markdown 的最初目標有著方向性的不同。在 markdown 原本的設計中，HTML 是其主要輸出對象；然而 pandoc 則是針對多種輸出格式而設計。因此，雖然 pandoc 同樣也允許直接嵌入 HTML 標籤，但並不鼓勵這樣的作法，取而代之的是 pandoc 提供了許多非 HTML 的方式，來讓使用者輸入像是定義清單、表格、數學公式以及腳註等諸如此類的重要文件元素。 段落 一個段落指的是一行以上的文字，跟在一行以上的空白行之後。換行字元會被當作是空白處理，因此你可以依自己喜好排列段落文字。如果你需要強制換行，在行尾放上兩個以上的空白字元即可。 Extension: escaped_line_breaks 一個反斜線後跟著一個換行字元，同樣也有強制換行的效果。 標題 有兩種不同形式的標題語法，Setext 以及 atx。 Setext 風格標題 Setext 風格的標題是由一行文字底下接著一行 = 符號（用於一階標題）或 - 符號（用於二階標題）所構成： 12345A level-one header==================A level-two header------------------ 標題的文字可以包含行內格式，例如強調（見下方 行內格式 一節）。 Atx 風格標題 Atx 風格的標題是由一到六個 # 符號以及一行文字所組成，你可以在文字後面加上任意數量的 # 符號。由行首起算的 # 符號數量決定了標題的階層： 123## A level-two header### A level-three header ### 如同 setext 風格標題，這裡的標題文字同樣可包含行內格式： 1# A level-one header with a [link](/url) and *emphasis* Extension: blank_before_header 原始 markdown 語法在標題之前並不需要預留空白行。Pandoc 則需要（除非標題位於文件最開始的地方）。這是因為以 # 符號開頭的情況在一般文字段落中相當常見，這會導致非預期的標題。例如下面的例子： 12I like several of their flavors of ice cream:#22, for example, and #5. HTML, LaTeX 與 ConTeXt 的標題識別符 Extension: header_attributes 在標題文字所在行的行尾，可以使用以下語法為標題加上屬性： 1&#123;#identifier .class .class key=value key=value&#125; 雖然這個語法也包含加入類別 (class) 以及鍵／值形式的屬性 (attribute)，但目前只有識別符 (identifier/ID) 在輸出時有實際作用（且只在部分格式的輸出，包括：HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Textile, AsciiDoc）。舉例來說，下面是將標題加上 foo 識別符的幾種方法： 123456# My header &#123;#foo&#125;## My header ## &#123;#foo&#125;My other header &#123;#foo&#125;--------------- （此語法與 PHP Markdown Extra 相容。） 具有 unnumbered 類別的標題將不會被編號，即使 --number-sections 的選項是開啟的。單一連字符號 (-) 等同於 .unnumbered，且更適用於非英文文件中。因此， 1# My header &#123;-&#125; 與下面這行是等價的 1# My header &#123;.unnumbered&#125; Extension: auto_identifiers 沒有明確指定 ID（識別符）的標題將會依據其標題文字，自動指派一個獨一無二的 ID。由標題文字推導 ID 的規則如下： 移除所有格式，連結等。 移除所有標點符號，除了底線、連字符號與句號。 以連字符號取代所有空白與換行字元。 將所有英文字母轉為小寫。 移除第一個字元前的所有內容（ID 不能以數字或標點符號開頭）。 如果剩下為空字串，則使用 section 作為 ID。 以下是一些範例， Header Identifier Header identifiers in HTML header-identifiers-in-html Dogs?–in my house? dogs--in-my-house [HTML], [S5], or [RTF]? html-s5-or-rtf 3. Applications applications 33 section 在大多數情況下，這些規則應該讓人能夠直接從標題文字推導出 ID。唯一的例外是當有多個標題具有同樣文字的情況；在這情況下，第一個標題的 ID 仍舊是透過以上規則推導而得；第二個則是在同樣 ID 後加上 -1；第三個加上 -2；以此類推。 在開啟 --toc|--table-of-contents 的選項時，這些 ID 是用來產生目錄 (Table of Contents) 所需的頁面連結。此外，這些 ID 也提供了一個簡便的方式來輸入跳到指定章節的連結。一個以 ID 產生的連結，其使用的語法看起來就像下面的例子： 12See the section on[header identifiers](#header-identifiers-in-html-latex-and-context). 然而要注意的一點是，只有在以 HTML、LaTeX 與 ConTeXt 格式輸出時，才能以這種方式產生對應的章節連結。 如果指定了 --section-divs 選項，則每一個小節都會以 div 標籤包住（或是 section 標籤，如果有指定 --html5 選項的話），並且 ID 會被附加在用來包住小節的 &lt;div&gt;（或是 &lt;section&gt;）標籤，而非附加在標題上。這使得整個小節都可以透過 javascript 來操作，或是採用不同的 CSS 設定。 Extension: implicit_header_references Pandoc 假設每個標題都定義了其參考連結，因此，相較於以下的連結語法 1[header identifiers](#header-identifiers-in-html) 你也可以單純只寫 1[header identifiers] 或 1[header identifiers][] 或 1[the section on header identifiers][header identifiers] 如果有多個標題具有同樣文字，對應的參考只會連結到第一個符合的標題，這時若要連結到其他符合的標題，就必須以先前提到的方式，明確指定連結到該標題的 ID。 與其他一般參考連結不同的是，這些參考連結是大小寫有別的。 注意：如果你有明確定義了任何一個標題的標示符，那麼選項 implicit_header_references 就沒有作用。 區塊引言 Markdown 使用 email 的習慣來建立引言區塊。一個引言區塊可以由一或多個段落或其他的區塊元素（如清單或標題）組成，並且其行首均是由一個 &gt; 符號加上一個空白作為開頭。（&gt; 符號不一定要位在該行最左邊，但也不能縮進超過三個空白）。 12345&gt; This is a block quote. This&gt; paragraph has two lines.&gt;&gt; 1. This is a list inside a block quote.&gt; 2. Second item. 有一個「偷懶」的形式：你只需要在引言區塊的第一行行首輸入 &gt; 即可，後面的行首可以省略符號： 12345&gt; This is a block quote. Thisparagraph has two lines.&gt; 1. This is a list inside a block quote.2. Second item. 由於區塊引言可包含其他區塊元素，而區塊引言本身也是區塊元素，所以，引言是可以嵌套入其他引言的。 123&gt; This is a block quote.&gt;&gt; &gt; A block quote within a block quote. Extension: blank_before_blockquote 原始 markdown 語法在區塊引言之前並不需要預留空白行。Pandoc 則需要（除非區塊引言位於文件最開始的地方）。這是因為以 &gt; 符號開頭的情況在一般文字段落中相當常見（也許由於斷行所致），這會導致非預期的格式。因此，除非是指定為 markdown_strict 格式，不然以下的語法在 pandoc 中將不會產生出嵌套區塊引言： 12&gt; This is a block quote.&gt;&gt; Nested. 字面（代碼）區塊 縮進代碼區塊 一段以四個空白（或一個 tab）縮進的文字區塊會被視為字面區塊 (Verbatim Block)：換句話說，特殊字元並不會轉換為任何格式，單純只以字面形式呈現，而所有的空白與換行也都會被保留。例如， 123if (a &gt; 3) &#123; moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);&#125; 位於行首的縮排（四個空白或一個 tab）並不會被視為字面區塊的一部分，因此在輸出時會被移除掉。 注意：在字面文字之間的空白行並不需要也以四個空白字元做開頭。 圍欄代碼區塊 Extension: fenced_code_blocks 除了標準的縮進代碼區塊外，Pandoc 也支援了圍欄 (fenced) 代碼區塊的語法。這區塊需以包含三個以上波浪線 (~) 或反引號 (`) 的一行作為開始，並以同樣符號且至少同樣長度的一行作為結束。所有介於開始與結束之間的文字行都會視為代碼。不需要額外的縮進： 12345​~~~~~~~if (a &gt; 3) &#123; moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);&#125;​~~~~~~~ 如同一般的代碼區塊，圍欄代碼區塊與其前後的文字之間必須以空白行作間隔。 如果代碼本身也包含了一整行的波浪線或反引號，那麼只要在區塊首尾處使用更長的波浪線或反引號即可： 12345​~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~​~~~~~~~~~~code including tildes​~~~~~~~~~~​~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 你也可以選擇性地使用以下語法附加屬性到代碼區塊上： 12345​~~~~ &#123;#mycode .haskell .numberLines startFrom=&quot;100&quot;&#125;qsort [] = []qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (&lt; x) xs) ++ [x] ++ qsort (filter (&gt;= x) xs)​~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 這裡的 mycode 為 ID，haskell 與 numberLines 是類別，而 startsFrom 則是值為 100 的屬性。有些輸出格式可以利用這些資訊來作語法高亮。目前有使用到這些資訊的輸出格式僅有 HTML 與 LaTeX。如果指定的輸出格式及語言類別有支援語法高亮，那麼上面那段代碼區塊將會以高亮並帶有行號的方式呈現。（要查詢支援的程式語言清單，可在命令列輸入 pandoc --version。）反之若無支援，則上面那段代碼區塊則會以下面的形式呈現： 12345&lt;pre id=&quot;mycode&quot; class=&quot;haskell numberLines&quot; startFrom=&quot;100&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt; ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 下面這個是針對代碼區塊只有指定程式語言屬性的簡便形式： 123​```haskellqsort [] = []​``` 這與下面這行的效果是相同的： 123​``` &#123;.haskell&#125;qsort [] = []​``` 要取消所有語法高亮，使用 --no-highlight 選項。要設定語法高亮的配色，則使用 --highlight-style。 行區塊 Extension: line_blocks 行區塊是一連串以豎線 (|) 加上一個空格所構成的連續行。行與行間的區隔在輸出時將會以原樣保留，行首的空白字元數目也一樣會被保留；反之，這些行將會以 markdown 的格式處理。這個語法在輸入詩句或地址時很有幫助。 12345678| The limerick packs laughs anatomical| In space that is quite economical.| But the good ones I&apos;ve seen| So seldom are clean| And the clean ones so seldom are comical| 200 Main St.| Berkeley, CA 94718 如果有需要的話，書寫時也可以將完整一行拆成多行，但後續行必須以空白作為開始。下面範例的前兩行在輸出時會被視為一整行： 1234| The Right Honorable Most Venerable and Righteous Samuel L. Constable, Jr.| 200 Main St.| Berkeley, CA 94718 這是從 reStructuredText 借來的語法。 清單 無序清單 無序清單是以項目符號作列舉的清單。每條項目都以項目符號 (*, + 或 -) 作開頭。下面是個簡單的例子： 123* one* two* three 這會產生一個「緊湊」清單。如果你想要一個「寬鬆」清單，也就是說以段落格式處理每個項目內的文字內容，那麼只要在每個項目間加上空白行即可： 12345* one* two* three 項目符號不能直接從行首最左邊處輸入，而必須以一至三個空白字元作縮進。項目符號後必須跟著一個空白字元。 清單項目中的接續行，若與該項目的第一行文字對齊（在項目符號之後），看上去會較為美觀： 123* here is my first list item.* and my second. 但 markdown 也允許以下「偷懶」的格式： 123* here is my firstlist item.* and my second. 四個空白規則 一個清單項目可以包含多個段落以及其他區塊等級的內容。然而，後續的段落必須接在空白行之後，並且以四個空白或一個 tab 作縮進。因此，如果項目裡第一個段落與後面段落對齊的話（也就是項目符號前置入兩個空白），看上去會比較整齊美觀： 12345678* First paragraph. Continued.* Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented eight spaces: &#123; code &#125; 清單項目也可以包含其他清單。在這情況下前置的空白行是可有可無的。嵌套清單必須以四個空白或一個 tab 作縮進： 123456789* fruits + apples - macintosh - red delicious + pears + peaches* vegetables + brocolli + chard 上一節提到，markdown 允許你以「偷懶」的方式書寫，項目的接續行可以不和第一行對齊。不過，如果一個清單項目中包含了多個段落或是其他區塊元素，那麼每個元素的第一行都必須縮進對齊。 12345678+ A lazy, lazy, listitem.+ Another one; this looksbad but is legal. Second paragraph of secondlist item. 注意：儘管針對接續段落的「四個空白規則」是出自於官方的 markdown syntax guide，但是作為對應參考用的 Markdown.pl 實作版本中並未遵循此一規則。所以當輸入時若接續段落的縮進少於四個空白時，pandoc 所輸出的結果會與 Markdown.pl 的輸出有所出入。 在 markdown syntax guide 中並未明確表示「四個空白規則」是否一體適用於 所有 位於清單項目裡的區塊元素上；規範文件中只提及了段落與代碼區塊。但文件暗示了此規則適用於所有區塊等級的內容（包含嵌套清單），並且 pandoc 以此方向進行解讀與實作。 有序清單 有序清單與無序清單相類似，唯一的差別在於清單項目是以列舉編號作開頭，而不是項目符號。 在原始 markdown 中，列舉編號是阿拉伯數字後面接著一個句點與空白。數字本身代表的數值會被忽略，因此下面兩個清單並無差別： 1231. one2. two3. three 上下兩個清單的輸出是相同的。 1235. one7. two1. three Extension: fancy_lists 與原始 markdown 不同的是，Pandoc 除了使用阿拉伯數字作為有序清單的編號外，也可以使用大寫或小寫的英文字母，以及羅馬數字。清單標記可以用括號包住，也可以單獨一個右括號，抑或是句號。如果清單標記是大寫字母接著一個句號，句號後請使用至少兩個空白字元。1 Extension: startnum 除了清單標記外，Pandoc 也能判讀清單的起始編號，這兩項資訊都會保留於輸出格式中。舉例來說，下面的輸入可以產生一個從編號 9 開始，以單括號為編號標記的清單，底下還跟著一個小寫羅馬數字的子清單： 123456 9) Ninth10) Tenth11) Eleventh i. subone ii. subtwo iii. subthree 當遇到不同形式的清單標記時，Pandoc 會重新開始一個新的清單。所以，以下的輸入會產生三份清單： 1234(2) Two(5) Three1. Four* Five 如果需要預設的有序清單標記符號，可以使用 #.： 123#. one#. two#. three 定義清單 Extension: definition_lists Pandoc 支援定義清單，其語法的靈感來自於 PHP Markdown Extra 以及 reStructuredText：2 1234567891011Term 1: Definition 1Term 2 with *inline markup*: Definition 2 &#123; some code, part of Definition 2 &#125; Third paragraph of definition 2. 每個專有名詞 (term) 都必須單獨存在於一行，後面可以接著一個空白行，也可以省略，但一定要接上一或多筆定義內容。一筆定義需由一個冒號或波浪線作開頭，可以接上一或兩個空白作為縮進。定義本身的內容主體（包括接在冒號或波浪線後的第一行）應該以四個空白縮進。一個專有名詞可以有多個定義，而每個定義可以包含一或多個區塊元素（段落、代碼區塊、清單等），每個區塊元素都要縮進四個空白或一個 tab。 如果你在定義內容後面留下空白行（如同上面的範例），那麼該段定義會被當作段落處理。在某些輸出格式中，這意謂著成對的專有名詞與定義內容間會有較大的空白間距。在定義與定義之間，以及定義與下個專有名詞間不要留空白行，即可產生一個比較緊湊的定義清單： 12345Term 1 ~ Definition 1Term 2 ~ Definition 2a ~ Definition 2b 編號範例清單 Extension: example_lists 這個特別的清單標記 @ 可以用來產生連續編號的範例清單。清單中第一個以 @ 標記的項目會被編號為 ‘1’，接著編號為 ‘2’，依此類推，直到文件結束。範例項目的編號不會侷限於單一清單中，而是文件中所有以 @ 為標記的項目均會次序遞增其編號，直到最後一個。舉例如下： 123456(@) My first example will be numbered (1).(@) My second example will be numbered (2).Explanation of examples.(@) My third example will be numbered (3). 編號範例可以加上標籤，並且在文件的其他地方作參照： 123(@good) This is a good example.As (@good) illustrates, ... 標籤可以是由任何英文字母、底線或是連字符號所組成的字串。 緊湊與寬鬆清單 在與清單相關的「邊界處理」上，Pandoc 與 Markdown.pl 有著不同的處理結果。考慮如下代碼： 1234567+ First+ Second: - Fee - Fie - Foe+ Third Pandoc 會將以上清單轉換為「緊湊清單」（在 “First”, “Second” 或 “Third” 之中沒有 &lt;p&gt; 標籤），而 markdown 則會在 “Second” 與 “Third” （但不包含 “First”）裡面置入 &lt;p&gt; 標籤，這是因為 “Third” 之前的空白行而造成的結果。Pandoc 依循著一個簡單規則：如果文字後面跟著空白行，那麼就會被視為段落。既然 “Second” 後面是跟著一個清單，而非空白行，那麼就不會被視為段落了。至於子清單的後面是不是跟著空白行，那就無關緊要了。（注意：即使是設定為 markdown_strict 格式，Pandoc 仍是依以上方式處理清單項目是否為段落的判定。這個處理方式與 markdown 官方語法規範裡的描述一致，然而卻與 Markdown.pl 的處理不同。） 結束一個清單 如果你在清單之後放入一個縮排的代碼區塊，會有什麼結果？ 1234- item one- item two &#123; my code block &#125; 問題大了！這邊 pandoc（其他的 markdown 實作也是如此）會將 { my code block } 視為 item two 這個清單項目的第二個段落來處理，而不會將其視為一個代碼區塊。 要在 item two 之後「切斷」清單，你可以插入一些沒有縮排、輸出時也不可見的內容，例如 HTML 的註解： 123456- item one- item two&lt;!-- end of list --&gt; &#123; my code block &#125; 當你想要兩個各自獨立的清單，而非一個大且連續的清單時，也可以運用同樣的技巧： 1234567891. one2. two3. three&lt;!-- --&gt;1. uno2. dos3. tres 分隔線 一行中若包含三個以上的 *, - 或 _ 符號（中間可以以空白字元分隔），則會產生一條分隔線： 123* * * *--------------- 表格 有四種表格的形式可以使用。前三種適用於等寬字型的編輯環境，例如 Courier。第四種則不需要直行的對齊，因此可以在比例字型的環境下使用。 簡單表格 Extension: simple_tables, table_captions 簡單表格看起來像這樣子： 1234567 Right Left Center Default------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1Table: Demonstration of simple table syntax. 表頭與資料列分別以一行為單位。直行的對齊則依照表頭的文字和其底下虛線的相對位置來決定：3 如果虛線與表頭文字的右側有切齊，而左側比表頭文字還長，則該直行為靠右對齊。 如果虛線與表頭文字的左側有切齊，而右側比表頭文字還長，則該直行為靠左對齊。 如果虛線的兩側都比表頭文字長，則該直行為置中對齊。 如果虛線與表頭文字的兩側都有切齊，則會套用預設的對齊方式（在大多數情況下，這將會是靠左對齊）。 表格底下必須接著一個空白行，或是一行虛線後再一個空白行。表格標題為可選的（上面的範例中有出現）。標題需是一個以 Table: （或單純只有 :）開頭作為前綴的段落，輸出時前綴的這部份會被去除掉。表格標題可以放在表格之前或之後。 表頭也可以省略，在省略表頭的情況下，表格下方必須加上一行虛線以清楚標明表格的範圍。例如： 12345------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1------- ------ ---------- ------- 當省略表頭時，直行的對齊會以表格內容的第一行資料列決定。所以，以上面的表格為例，各直行的對齊依序會是靠右、靠左、置中以及靠右對齊。 多行表格 Extension: multiline_tables, table_captions 多行表格允許表頭與表格資料格的文字能以複數行呈現（但不支援橫跨多欄或縱跨多列的資料格）。以下為範例： 1234567891011121314------------------------------------------------------------- Centered Default Right Left Header Aligned Aligned Aligned----------- ------- --------------- ------------------------- First row 12.0 Example of a row that spans multiple lines. Second row 5.0 Here&apos;s another one. Note the blank line between rows.-------------------------------------------------------------Table: Here&apos;s the caption. It, too, may spanmultiple lines. 看起來很像簡單表格，但兩者間有以下差別： 在表頭文字之前，必須以一列虛線作為開頭（除非有省略表頭）。 必須以一列虛線作為表格結尾，之後接一個空白行。 資料列與資料列之間以空白行隔開。 在多行表格中，表格分析器會計算各直行的欄寬，並在輸出時盡可能維持各直行在原始文件中的相對比例。因此，要是你覺得某些欄位在輸出時不夠寬，你可以在 markdown 的原始檔中加寬一點。 和簡單表格一樣，表頭在多行表格中也是可以省略的： 12345678910----------- ------- --------------- ------------------------- First row 12.0 Example of a row that spans multiple lines. Second row 5.0 Here&apos;s another one. Note the blank line between rows.----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------: Here&apos;s a multiline table without headers. 多行表格中可以單只包含一個資料列，但該資料列之後必須接著一個空白行（然後才是標示表格結尾的一行虛線）。如果沒有此空白行，此表格將會被解讀成簡單表格。 格框表格 Extension: grid_tables, table_captions 格框表格看起來像這樣： 1234567891011: Sample grid table.+---------------+---------------+--------------------+| Fruit | Price | Advantages |+===============+===============+====================+| Bananas | $1.34 | - built-in wrapper || | | - bright color |+---------------+---------------+--------------------+| Oranges | $2.10 | - cures scurvy || | | - tasty |+---------------+---------------+--------------------+ 以 = 串成的一行區分了表頭與表格本體，這在沒有表頭的表格中也是可以省略的。在格框表格中的資料格可以包含任意的區塊元素（複數段落、代碼區塊、清單等等）。不支援對齊，也不支援橫跨多欄或縱跨多列的資料格。格框表格可以在 Emacs table mode 下輕鬆建立。 管線表格 Extension: pipe_tables, table_captions 管線表格看起來像這樣： 1234567| Right | Left | Default | Center ||------:|:-----|---------|:------:|| 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 || 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 || 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | : Demonstration of simple table syntax. 這個語法與 PHP markdown extra 中的表格語法 相同。開始與結尾的管線字元是可選的，但各直行間則必須以管線區隔。上面範例中的冒號表明了對齊方式。表頭可以省略，但表頭下的水平虛線必須保留，因為虛線上定義了資料欄的對齊方式。 因為管線界定了各欄之間的邊界，表格的原始碼並不需要像上面例子中各欄之間保持直行對齊。所以，底下一樣是個完全合法（雖然醜陋）的管線表格： 12345fruit| price-----|-----:apple|2.05pear|1.37orange|3.09 管線表格的資料格不能包含如段落、清單之類的區塊元素，也不能包含複數行文字。 注意：Pandoc 也可以看得懂以下形式的管線表格，這是由 Emacs 的 orgtbl-mod 所繪製： 1234| One | Two ||-----+-------|| my | table || is | nice | 主要的差別在於以 + 取代了部分的 |。其他的 orgtbl 功能並未支援。如果要指定非預設的直行對齊形式，你仍然需要在上面的表格中自行加入冒號。 文件標題區塊 （譯註：本節中提到的「標題」均指 Title，而非 Headers） Extension: pandoc_title_block 如果檔案以文件標題（Title）區塊開頭 123% title% author(s) (separated by semicolons)% date 這部份將不會作為一般文字處理，而會以書目資訊的方式解析。（這可用在像是單一 LaTeX 或是 HTML 輸出文件的書名上。）這個區塊僅能包含標題，或是標題與作者，或是標題、作者與日期。如果你只想包含作者卻不想包含標題，或是只有標題與日期而沒有作者，你得利用空白行： 123456%% Author% My title%% June 15, 2006 標題可以包含多行文字，但接續行必須以空白字元開頭，像是： 12% My title on multiple lines 如果文件有多個作者，作者也可以分列在不同行並以空白字元作開頭，或是以分號間隔，或是兩者並行。所以，下列各種寫法得到的結果都是相同的： 1234567% Author One Author Two% Author One; Author Two% Author One; Author Two 日期就只能寫在一行之內。 所有這三個 metadata 欄位都可以包含標準的行內格式（斜體、連結、腳註等等）。 文件標題區塊一定會被分析處理，但只有在 --standaline (-s) 選項被設定時才會影響輸出內容。在輸出 HTML 時，文件標題會出現的地方有兩個：一個是在文件的 &lt;head&gt; 區塊裡－－這會顯示在瀏覽器的視窗標題上－－另外一個是文件的 &lt;body&gt; 區塊最前面。位於 &lt;head&gt; 裡的文件標題可以選擇性地加上前綴文字（透過 --title-prefix 或 -T 選項）。而在 &lt;body&gt; 裡的文件標題會以 H1 元素呈現，並附帶 “title” 類別 (class)，這樣就能藉由 CSS 來隱藏顯示或重新定義格式。如果以 -T 選項指定了標題前綴文字，卻沒有設定文件標題區塊裡的標題，那麼前綴文字本身就會被當作是 HTML 的文件標題。 而 man page 的輸出器會分析文件標題區塊的標題行，以解出標題、man page section number，以及其他頁眉 (header) 頁腳 (footer) 所需要的資訊。一般會假設標題行的第一個單字為標題，標題後也許會緊接著一個以括號包住的單一數字，代表 section number（標題與括號之間沒有空白）。在此之後的其他文字則為頁腳與頁眉文字。頁腳與頁眉文字之間是以單獨的一個管線符號 (|) 作為區隔。所以， 1% PANDOC(1) 將會產生一份標題為 PANDOC 且 section 為 1 的 man page。 1% PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals 產生的 man page 會再加上 “Pandoc User Manuals” 在頁腳處。 1% PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals | Version 4.0 產生的 man page 會再加上 “Version 4.0” 在頁眉處。 反斜線跳脫字元 Extension: all_symbols_escapable 除了在代碼區塊或行內代碼之外，任何標點符號或空白字元前面只要加上一個反斜線，都能使其保留字面原義，而不會進行格式的轉義解讀。因此，舉例來說，下面的寫法 1*\*hello\** 輸出後會得到 1&lt;em&gt;*hello*&lt;/em&gt; 而不是 1&lt;strong&gt;hello&lt;/strong&gt; 這條規則比原始的 markdown 規則來得好記許多，原始規則中，只有以下字元才有支援反斜線跳脫，不作進一步轉義： 1\`*_&#123;&#125;[]()&gt;#+-.! （然而，如果使用了 markdown_strict 格式，那麼就會採用原始的 markdown 規則） 一個反斜線之後的空白字元會被解釋為不斷行的空白 (nonbreaking space)。這在 TeX 的輸出中會顯示為 ~，而在 HTML 與 XML 則是顯示為 \&amp;#160; 或 \&amp;nbsp;。 一個反斜線之後的換行字元（例如反斜線符號出現在一行的最尾端）則會被解釋為強制換行。這在 TeX 的輸出中會顯示為 \\，而在 HTML 裡則是 &lt;br /&gt;。相對於原始 markdown 是以在行尾加上兩個空白字元這種「看不見」的方式進行強制換行，反斜線接換行字元會是比較好的替代方案。 反斜線跳脫字元在代碼上下文中不起任何作用。 智慧型標點符號 Extension 如果指定了 --smart 選項，pandoc 將會輸出正式印刷用的標點符號，像是將 straight quotes 轉換為 curly quotes4、--- 轉為破折號 (em-dashes)，-- 轉為連接號 (en-dashes)，以及將 ... 轉為刪節號。不斷行空格 (Nonbreaking spaces) 將會插入某些縮寫詞之後，例如 “Mr.”。 注意：如果你的 LaTeX template 使用了 csquotes 套件，pandoc 會自動偵測並且使用 \enquote{...} 在引言文字上。 行內格式 強調 要 強調 某些文字，只要以 * 或 _ 符號前後包住即可，像這樣： 12This text is _emphasized with underscores_, and thisis *emphasized with asterisks*. 重複兩個 * 或 _ 符號以產生 更強烈的強調： 1This is **strong emphasis** and __with underscores__. 一個前後以空白字元包住，或是前面加上反斜線的 * 或 _ 符號，都不會轉換為強調格式： 1This is * not emphasized *, and \*neither is this\*. Extension: intraword_underscores 因為 _ 字元有時會使用在單字或是 ID 之中，所以 pandoc 不會把被字母包住的 _ 解讀為強調標記。如果有需要特別強調單字中的一部分，就用 *： 1feas*ible*, not feas*able*. 刪除線 Extension: strikeout 要將一段文字加上水平線作為刪除效果，將該段文字前後以 ~~ 包住即可。例如， 1This ~~is deleted text.~~ 上標與下標 Extension: superscript, subscript 要輸入上標可以用 ^ 字元將要上標的文字包起來；要輸入下標可以用 ~ 字元將要下標的文字包起來。直接看範例， 1H~2~O is a liquid. 2^10^ is 1024. 如果要上標或下標的文字中包含了空白，那麼這個空白字元之前必須加上反斜線。（這是為了避免一般使用下的 ~ 和 ^ 在非預期的情況下產生出意外的上標或下標。）所以，如果你想要讓字母 P 後面跟著下標文字 ‘a cat’，那麼就要輸入 P~a\ cat~，而不是 P~a cat~。 字面文字 要讓一小段文字直接以其字面形式呈現，可以用反引號將其包住： 1What is the difference between `&gt;&gt;=` and `&gt;&gt;`? 如果字面文字中也包含了反引號，那就使用雙重反引號包住： 1Here is a literal backtick `` ` ``. （在起始反引號後的空白以及結束反引號前的空白都會被忽略。） 一般性的規則如下，字面文字區段是以連續的反引號字元作為開始（反引號後的空白字元為可選），一直到同樣數目的反引號字元出現才結束（反引號前的空白字元也為可選）。 要注意的是，反斜線跳脫字元（以及其他 markdown 結構）在字面文字的上下文中是沒有效果的： 1This is a backslash followed by an asterisk: `\*`. Extension: inline_code_attributes 與圍欄代碼區塊一樣，字面文字也可以附加屬性： 1`&lt;$&gt;`&#123;.haskell&#125; 數學 Extension: tex_math_dollars 所有介於兩個 $ 字元之間的內容將會被視為 TeX 數學公式處理。開頭的 $ 右側必須立刻接上任意文字，而結尾 $ 的左側同樣也必須緊挨著文字。這樣一來，$20,000 and $30,000 就不會被當作數學公式處理了。如果基於某些原因，有必須使用 $ 符號將其他文字括住的需求時，那麼可以在 $ 前使用反斜線跳脫字元，這樣 $ 就不會被當作數學公式的分隔符。 TeX 數學公式會在所有輸出格式中印出。至於會以什麼方式演算編排 (render) 則取決於輸出的格式： Markdown, LaTeX, Org-Mode, ConTeXt 公式會以字面文字呈現在兩個 $ 符號之間。 reStructuredText 公式會使用 此處 所描述的 :math: 這個 “interpreted text role” 來進行演算編排。 AsciiDoc 公式會以 latexmath:[...] 演算編排。 Texinfo 公式會在 @math 指令中演算編排。 groff man 公式會以去掉 $ 後的字面文字演算編排。 MediaWiki 公式會在 &lt;math&gt; 標籤中演算編排。 Textile 公式會在 &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt; 標籤中演算編排。 RTF, OpenDocument, ODT 如果可以的話，公式會以 unicode 字元演算編排，不然就直接使用字面字元。 Docbook 如果使用了 --mathml 旗標，公式就會在 inlineequation 或 informalequation 標籤中使用 mathml 演算編排。否則就會盡可能使用 unicode 字元演算編排。 Docx 公式會以 OMML 數學標記的方式演算編排。 FictionBook2 如果有使用 --webtex 選項，公式會以 Google Charts 或其他相容的網路服務演算編排為圖片，並下載嵌入於電子書中。否則就會以字面文字顯示。 HTML, Slidy, DZSlides, S5, EPUB 公式會依照以下命令列選項的設置，以不同的方法演算編排為 HTML 代碼。 預設方式是將 TeX 數學公式盡可能地以 unicode 字元演算編排，如同 RTF、DocBook 以及 OpenDocument 的輸出。公式會被放在附有屬性 class=&quot;math&quot; 的 span 標籤內，所以可以在需要時給予不同的樣式，使其突出於周遭的文字內容。 如果使用了 --latexmathml 選項，TeX 數學公式會被顯示於 $ 或 $$ 字元中，並放在附帶 LaTeX 類別的 &lt;span&gt; 標籤裡。這段內容會用 LaTeXMathML script 演算編排為數學公式。（這個方法無法適用於所有瀏覽器，但在 Firefox 中是有效的。在不支援 LaTeXMathML 的瀏覽器中，TeX 數學公式會單純的以兩個 $ 字元間的字面文字呈現。） 如果使用了 --jsmath 選項，TeX數學公式會放在 &lt;span&gt; 標籤（用於行內數學公式）或 &lt;div&gt; 標籤（用於區塊數學公式）中，並附帶類別屬性 math。這段內容會使用 jsMath script 來演算編排。 如果使用了 --mimetex 選項，mimeTeX CGI script 會被呼叫來產生每個 TeX 數學公式的圖片。這適用於所有瀏覽器。--mimetex 選項有一個可選的 URL 參數。如果沒有指定 URL，它會假設 mimeTeX CGI script 的位置在 /cgi-bin/mimetex.cig。 如果使用了 --gladtex 選項，TeX 數學公式在 HTML 的輸出中會被 &lt;eq&gt; 標籤包住。產生的 htex 檔案之後可以透過 gladTeX 處理，這會針對每個數學公式生成圖片，並於最後生成一個包含這些圖片連結的 html 檔案。所以，整個處理流程如下： 123pandoc -s --gladtex myfile.txt -o myfile.htexgladtex -d myfile-images myfile.htex# produces myfile.html and images in myfile-images 如果使用了 --webtex 選項，TeX 數學公式會被轉換為 &lt;img&gt; 標籤並連結到一個用以轉換公式為圖片的外部 script。公式將會編碼為 URL 可接受格式並且與指定的 URL 參數串接。如果沒有指定 URL，那麼將會使用 Google Chart API (http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=)。 如果使用了 --mathjax 選項，TeX 數學公式將會被包在 \(...\)（用於行內數學公式）或 \[...\]（用於區塊數學公式）之間顯示，並且放在附帶類別 math 的 &lt;span&gt; 標籤之中。這段內容會使用 MathJax script 演算編排為頁面上的數學公式。 Raw HTML Extension: raw_html Markdown 允許你在文件中的任何地方插入原始 HTML（或 DocBook）指令（除了在字面文字上下文處，此時的 &lt;, &gt; 和 &amp; 都會按其字面意義顯示）。（技術上而言這不算擴充功能，因為原始 markdown 本身就有提供此功能，但做成擴充形式便可以在有特殊需要的時候關閉此功能。） 輸出 HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown 以及 Textile 等格式時，原始 HTML 代碼會不作修改地保留至輸出檔案中；而其他格式的輸出內容則會將原始 HTML 代碼去除掉。 Extension: markdown_in_html_blocks 原始 markdown 允許你插入 HTML「區塊」：所謂的 HTML 區塊是指，上下各由一個空白行所隔開，開始與結尾均由所在行最左側開始的一連串對稱均衡的 HTML 標籤。在這個區塊中，任何內容都會當作是 HTML 來分析，而不再視為 markdown；所以（舉例來說），* 符號就不再代表強調。 當指定格式為 markdown_strict 時，Pandoc 會以上述方式處理；但預設情況下，Pandoc 能夠以 markdown 語法解讀 HTML 區塊標籤中的內容。舉例說明，Pandoc 能夠將底下這段 123456&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;*one*&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;[a link](http://google.com)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 轉換為 123456&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 而 Markdown.pl 則是保留該段原樣。 這個規則只有一個例外：那就是介於 &lt;script&gt; 與 &lt;style&gt; 之間的文字都不會被拿來當作 markdown 解讀。 這邊與原始 markdown 的分歧，主要是為了讓 markdown 能夠更便利地混入 HTML 區塊元素。比方說，一段 markdown 文字可以用 &lt;div&gt; 標籤將其前後包住來進行樣式指定，而不用擔心裡面的 markdown 不會被解譯到。 Raw TeX Extension: raw_tex 除了 HTML 之外，pandoc 也接受文件中嵌入原始 LaTeX, TeX 以及 ConTeXt 代碼。行內 TeX 指令會被保留並不作修改地輸出至 LaTeX 與 ConTeXt 格式中。所以，舉例來說，你可以使用 LaTeX 來導入 BibTeX 的引用文獻： 1This result was proved in \cite&#123;jones.1967&#125;. 請注意在 LaTeX 環境下時，像是底下 123456\begin&#123;tabular&#125;&#123;|l|l|&#125;\hlineAge &amp; Frequency \\ \hline18--25 &amp; 15 \\26--35 &amp; 33 \\36--45 &amp; 22 \\ \hline\end&#123;tabular&#125; 位在 begin 與 end 標籤之間的內容，都會被當作是原始 LaTeX 資料解讀，而不會視為 markdown。 行內 LaTeX 在輸出至 Markdown, LaTeX 及 ConTeXt 之外的格式時會被忽略掉。 LaTeX 巨集 Extension: latex_macros 當輸出格式不是 LaTeX 時，pandoc 會分析 LaTeX 的 \newcommand 和 \renewcommand 定義，並套用其產生的巨集到所有 LaTeX 數學公式中。所以，舉例來說，下列指令對於所有的輸出格式均有作用，而非僅僅作用於 LaTeX 格式： 123\newcommand&#123;\tuple&#125;[1]&#123;\langle #1 \rangle&#125;$\tuple&#123;a, b, c&#125;$ 在 LaTeX 的輸出中，\newcommand 定義會單純不作修改地保留至輸出結果。 連結 Markdown 接受以下數種指定連結的方式。 自動連結 如果你用角括號將一段 URL 或是 email 位址包起來，它會自動轉換成連結： 12&lt;http://google.com&gt;&lt;sam@green.eggs.ham&gt; 行內連結 一個行內連結包含了位在方括號中的連結文字，以及方括號後以圓括號包起來的 URL。（你可以選擇性地在 URL 後面加入連結標題，標題文字要放在引號之中。） 12This is an [inline link](/url), and here&apos;s [one witha title](http://fsf.org &quot;click here for a good time!&quot;). 方括號與圓括號之間不能有空白。連結文字可以包含格式（例如強調），但連結標題則否。 參考連結 一個 明確 的參考連結包含兩個部分，連結本身以及連結定義，其中連結定義可以放在文件的任何地方（不論是放在連結所在處之前或之後）。 連結本身是由兩組方括號所組成，第一組方括號中為連結文字，第二組為連結標籤。（在兩個方括號間可以有空白。）連結定義則是以方括號框住的連結標籤作開頭，後面跟著一個冒號一個空白，再接著一個 URL，最後可以選擇性地（在一個空白之後）加入由引號或是圓括號包住的連結標題。 以下是一些範例： 1234[my label 1]: /foo/bar.html &quot;My title, optional&quot;[my label 2]: /foo[my label 3]: http://fsf.org (The free software foundation)[my label 4]: /bar#special &apos;A title in single quotes&apos; 連結的 URL 也可以選擇性地以角括號包住： 1[my label 5]: &lt;http://foo.bar.baz&gt; 連結標題可以放在第二行： 12[my label 3]: http://fsf.org &quot;The free software foundation&quot; 需注意連結標籤並不區分大小寫。所以下面的例子會建立合法的連結： 123Here is [my link][FOO][Foo]: /bar/baz 在一個 隱性 參考連結中，第二組方括號的內容是空的，甚至可以完全地略去： 123See [my website][], or [my website].[my website]: http://foo.bar.baz 注意：在 Markdown.pl 以及大多數其他 markdown 實作中，參考連結的定義不能存在於嵌套結構中，例如清單項目或是區塊引言。Pandoc lifts this arbitrary seeming restriction。所以雖然下面的語法在幾乎所有其他實作中都是錯誤的，但在 pandoc 中可以正確處理： 123&gt; My block [quote].&gt;&gt; [quote]: /foo 內部連結 要連結到同一份文件的其他章節，可使用自動產生的 ID（參見 HTML, LaTeX 與 ConTeXt 的標題識別符 一節後半）。例如： 1See the [Introduction](#introduction). 或是 123See the [Introduction].[Introduction]: #introduction 內部連結目前支援的格式有 HTML（包括 HTML slide shows 與 EPUB）、LaTeX 以及 ConTeXt。 圖片 在連結語法的前面加上一個 ! 就是圖片的語法了。連結文字將會作為圖片的替代文字（alt text）： 12345![la lune](lalune.jpg &quot;Voyage to the moon&quot;)![movie reel][movie reel]: movie.gif 附上說明的圖片 Extension: implicit_figures 一個圖片若自身單獨存在一個段落中，那麼將會以附上圖片說明 (caption) 的圖表 (figure) 形式呈現。5（在 LaTeX 中，會使用圖表環境；在 HTML 中，圖片會被放在具有 figure 類別的 div 元素中，並會附上一個具有 caption 類別的 p 元素。）圖片的替代文字同時也會用來作為圖片說明。 1![This is the caption](/url/of/image.png) 如果你只是想要個一般的行內圖片，那麼只要讓圖片不是段落裡唯一的元素即可。一個簡單的方法是在圖片後面插入一個不斷行空格： 1![This image won&apos;t be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\ 腳註 Extension: footnotes Pandoc’s markdown 支援腳註功能，使用以下的語法： 1234567891011121314151617Here is a footnote reference,1 and another.[^longnote] 腳註參考用的 ID 不得包含空白、tabs 或換行字元。這些 ID 只會用來建立腳註位置與腳註文字的對應關連；在輸出時，腳註將會依序遞增編號。 腳註本身不需要放在文件的最後面。它們可以放在文件裡的任何地方，但不能被放入區塊元素（清單、區塊引言、表格等）之中。 **Extension:** `inline_notes` Pandoc 也支援了行內腳註（儘管，與一般腳註不同，行內腳註不能包含多個段落）。其語法如下： 123Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, sinceyou don&apos;t have to pick an identifier and move down to type thenote.] 行內與一般腳註可以自由交錯使用。 引用 Extension: citations Pandoc 能夠以數種形式自動產生引用與參考書目（使用 Andrea Rossato 的 hs-citeproc）。為了使用這項功能，你需要一個下列其中一種格式的參考書目資料庫： Format File extension MODS .mods BibLaTeX .bib BibTeX .bibtex RIS .ris EndNote .enl EndNote XML .xml ISI .wos MEDLINE .medline Copac .copac JSON citeproc .json 需注意的是副檔名 .bib 一般而言同時適用於 BibTeX 與 BibLaTeX 的檔案，不過你可以使用 .bibtex 來強制指定 BibTeX。 你需要使用命令列選項 --bibliography 來指定參考書目檔案（如果有多個書目檔就得反覆指定）。 預設情況下，pandoc 會在引用文獻與參考書目中使用芝加哥「作者－日期」格式。要使用其他的格式，你需要用 --csl 選項來指定一個 CSL 1.0 格式的檔案。關於建立與修改 CSL 格式的入門可以在 http://citationstyles.org/downloads/primer.html 這邊找到。https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles 是 CSL 格式的檔案庫。也可以在 http://zotero.org/styles 以簡單的方式瀏覽。 引用資訊放在方括號中，以分號區隔。每一條引用都會有個 key，由 @ 加上資料庫中的引用 ID 組成，並且可以選擇性地包含前綴、定位以及後綴。以下是一些範例： 12345Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99]. 在 @ 前面的減號 (-) 將會避免作者名字在引用中出現。這可以用在已經提及作者的文章場合中： 1Smith says blah [-@smith04]. 你也可以在文字中直接插入引用資訊，方式如下： 123@smith04 says blah.@smith04 [p. 33] says blah. 如果引用格式檔需要產生一份引用作品的清單，這份清單會被放在文件的最後面。一般而言，你需要以一個適當的標題結束你的文件： 123last paragraph...# References 如此一來參考書目就會被放在這個標題後面了。 之所以有這條規則，主要是要避免以人名頭文字縮寫作為開頭的段落所帶來的混淆，像是 1B. Russell was an English philosopher. 這樣就不會被當作清單項目了。 這條規則並不會避免以下 1(C) 2007 Joe Smith 這樣的敘述被解釋成清單項目。在這情形下，可以使用反斜線： 1(C\) 2007 Joe Smith ↩ David Wheeler 對於 markdown 的建議也同時影響了我。↩ 這個方案是由 Michel Fortin 在 Markdown discussion list 的討論中所提出。↩ 譯註：straight quotes 指的是左右兩側都長得一樣的引號，例如我們直接在鍵盤上打出來的單引號或雙引號；curly quotes 則是左右兩側不同，有從兩側向內包夾視覺效果的引號。↩ 這項功能尚未在 RTF, OpenDocument 或 ODT 格式上實現。在這些格式中，你會得到一個在段落中只包含自己的圖片，而無圖片說明。↩ Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus 1.Here is the footnote.[^longnote]: Here’s one with multiple blocks. Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that theybelong to the previous footnote. { some.code } The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line.
